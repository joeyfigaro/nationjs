# React
## Why it's "functional"

## Virtual DOM
Performance upgrade; quick DOM node deductions

## Server-side Formula
`v = f(d)`
`view = makeHTML(data)`

> We very rarely are able to say with any confidence that our app remains in sync as we change it

## Unidirectional data-flow vs. Virtual DOM
Virtual DOM is the reason unidirectional data-flow paradigm works effectively/performantly
